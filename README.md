# Loan_Default_Prediction_Keras_DeepLearning
The goal of this project is to build a classification model using deep learning library (Keras) for predicting a loan turning default. 

- This notebook uses a subset of lending club dataset obtained from Kaggle. The file is very big (>100MB) and can be accessed from the following link:

- LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California.[3] It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. LendingClub is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.

- Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), can we build a model that can predict whether or not a borrower will pay back their loan? This way in the future when we get a new potential customer, we can assess whether or not they are likely to pay back the loan. 

- The "loan_status" column contains our label.
